Dave Hale's package for teaching and research.
If you are in one of Dave's classes, you will probably use this package.
<p>
If and when classes here become more generally useful, they are moved 
to another more appropriate package. 
This package is part of the Mines JTK only because these classes may 
serve as useful examples of how to use classes in other JTK packages.
