Linear algebra via LAPACK.
<p>
This Java package depends on CLAPACK, which is LAPACK (Linear Algebra 
PACKage), written in Fortran and converted to C.
The computational efficiency of CLAPACK depends primarily on the BLAS 
(Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines).
BLAS libraries are typically tuned for different processors.
<p>
For more information on LAPACK, see
Anderson, E., Bai, Z., Bischof, C., Blackford, S., Demmel, J., Dongarra, J., 
Du Croz, J., Greenbaum, A, Hammarling, S, McKenney, A, and Sorensen, D., 
1999, LAPACK Users' Guide, 3rd Edition, SIAM.
<p>
The interface presented by this package is adapted from that of the
public-domain pure Java package Jama, which was developed by 
Joe Hicklin, Cleve Moler, and Peter Webb of The MathWorks, Inc., and by
Ronald Boisvert, Bruce Miller, Roldan Pozo, and Karin Remington of the
National Institue of Standards and Technology.
